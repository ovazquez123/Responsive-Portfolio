			<p> Hello Everyone! I am Omar Esai Vazquez and I am currently a UCSD Extension Coding Bootcamp Student. My current projects are related to HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Its been a dream of mine to be able to code. I've never wanted something so bad other than to be a programmer/developer. I'd ove to work for a company based in San Diego. I want to be a Web Developer, I'd love to be working within those capacities. Mirium is a company that seems very atractive to me currently. When its all said and done I want to look back and say damn I created an enormous amount of projects for myself and for others.</p>

			<p>My background consists of a BA in Sociology from UCSD. I'd like to one day persue a Masters in Computer Science. By the time I'm done with this coding bootcamp I hope to be proficient in all languages taught to me within these 6 months</p>
